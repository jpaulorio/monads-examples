# Practical Monads Examples (in C# and Scala)

## What's in this repo?

This repo contains examples of how Monads can be leveraged on both Scala and C# programming languages.

That said, this is by no means meant to be a comprehensive list of Monads applications.

My goal is to shed some light on how some languages can take advantage of Monads to allow for a more composable, concise and cleaner code.

Those examples are ***based*** on the following articles:
